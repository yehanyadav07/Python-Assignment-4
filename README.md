Mini Project – Programming for Problem Solving using Python Author: Yehan Roll No: 2501730259

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes real-world weather data and visualizes important climate parameters such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. It demonstrates data cleaning, statistical computation, and graphical visualization using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

The goal is to understand patterns in daily and monthly weather trends and present them through clean and meaningful plots.
